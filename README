accumulator_config.py.default is a template for the configuration file.
Copy it to accumulator_config.py 
(cp accumulator_config.py.default accumulator_config.py)
before starting the accumulator. Edit accumulator_config.py 
to reflect your url to the accumulator and your desired number 
of POST attempts.

To start the accumulator, type:
bin/python accumulator.py

The accumulator has two GET routines and a POST 
routine.  The send_label_to_accumulator function
in conveyor_belt.py takes a package label, turns it
into a json format and sends the label to the accumulator.
